III INTRODUCTION TO THE GAME
============================

1) Introduction To The Story Line:
Ed is a friendly but clumsy extraterrestrial who accidentally dropped a can of toxic liquid
from space, morphing the world into a bizarre wasteland ! 
Mountains rise up, oceans appear and disappear. Plants, animals and human beings undergo
bizarre metamorphoses. Not only did the can hurt the Earth, but it landed close to Grögh, a
drunken, old-fashioned brute with no future.

Ed is tried for his carelessness, and is condemned to repair his blunder. He is sent to Earth
to retrieve the can before it provokes new disasters. Ed has just landed on Earth when he
realizes that a tremendous transformation has already taken place and that Grögh is now in 
possession of the can that gives him total control over the World!



2) Structure Of The Game

Tonic trouble is an action adventure game based on the exploration of 11 different levels.
The goal of the game is very clear thanks to the introduction sequence: Ed must find 
the evil Grögh's tower and retrieve the can with magic powers that he dropped on the earth.
Ed will need all the help he can find to get out of this Tonic Trouble ! To remedy this 
ecological disaster, Ed will have to explore weird worlds and acomplish perilous missions. 
He will encounter and sometimes fight crazy characters including killer vegetables, paranoid
inventions and dangerous Helling Guards. 
Hopefully Ed has some friends :  the Doc a brilliant inventor, Suzy, his daughter 
and the mysterious Agent XYZ, Leader of the resistance against Grögh ! 
Ed has also some interesting powers given by the Doc and he can also sometimes transform
himself into ... Super Ed !     



IV HOW TO PLAY THE GAME
=======================

1) Controlling Ed
-----------------

Principle:
Four keys on a keyboard (or buttons on a gamepad) and the directional arrows on a keyboard 
(cross arrows or control stick on a gamepad) are used for all control of Ed and Super Ed. 
The keys are named: "Jump", "Fire", "Run", and "Action". By default the settings are: 

> "Jump": Z
> "Fire": Space Bar
> "Walk": left shift
> "Action": left control


How To Control Ed:
Note: All powers are not available at the beginning of the game. Getting them is part 
of the game's challenge. 

> Run: directional arrows.
> Walk: "run" (left shift) + directional arrows.
> Jump: "jump" (Z). 
> Hit: "fire" (Space Bar). 
> Swim: "action" (left control) + directional arrows. 
> Start flying: "jump" (Z). (once in the air). 
> Controls while flying: directional arrows (like a flight simulator).
> Pogo stick mode: "jump" + "action" (A+left control). 
> Exit pogo stick mode: "jump" (Z). 
> Enter the blowpipe mode: "action" (left control). 
> First person wiew in blowpipe mode: "Z"  
> Shoot with the blowpipe: "fire".
> Exit blowpipe mode: "action" (left control).
> Interact with an object: stand next to it and push "action".


Note: For French keyboards, the A key is replaced by W.


4) Camera Control:
------------------
Use the numeric keyboard arrows to choose the viewing angle:
Camera angle					5
Rotate the camera to the left			4
Rotate the camera to the right			6
Place the camera behind Ed 			2
To see the action through Ed's eyes, and look around ..  0 + the directional arrows 



V TROUBLE SHOOTING
==================

Playing on a P166 non MMX:
--------------------------
>If you play on a P166 non MMX, you will have better performance by lowering the video settings (Option/Control/Video)


Keyboard Controls: 
------------------
> You must enable the numeric keypad in order to control the camera as described in 
section 4.
> Some keys can not be chosen for controlling Ed since they are needed for the interface. 
These keys are: Tab, Escape, Enter, all Function keys (F1...), all keys of the numeric 
keypad, ^, [, Print Screen, Scroll Lock, Pause, Caps Lock, Enter.
> Control + Alt + Delete is not functional when Tonic runs. This is due to the use of 
DirectX 5.

Sound: 
------
> Sound Driver Busy: If your sound driver is busy when you launch Tonic Trouble you will 
be asked if you either want to free the sound driver (by closing the application that 
is using it) or play Tonic Trouble without sound.


Loading Time: 
-------------
> The install progression bar may not always be accurate since loading time depends on 
your system performance. So don't be afraid if the bar is complete and you still need 
to wait a few seconds to access the level.
