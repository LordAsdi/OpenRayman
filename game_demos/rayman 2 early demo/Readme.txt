
Readme for Rayman2 Demo Version
================================================================
This file will attempt to explain the basics of installing and 
playing Rayman 2 on the PC. Please note that this is a game 
still in development and there are still a number of bugs. If 
you have feedback or comments on this demo, please send them to:  
yourfeedback@rayman2.com


To play the game you must have either Direct-X(tm) or Glide(tm) 
installed. This demo will not install them for you.

================================================================
Controls
===============================================================
We recommend playing with a game pad such as the Microsoft 
Sidewinder (tm). However, it is possible to play with a keyboard. 
If you play with a keyboard, remember that all movements are 
relative to the camera and not to Rayman. For example, if you 
want to move right relative to the camera, press the right arrow 
button.

===============================================================
Keyboard Controls for an american QWERTY keyboard
=============================================================
The arrow keys are used to move in the desired direction

A - to jump - also useful for skipping texts
Space Bar - to fire
Ctrl - the left control key - to strafe - useful in combat
Shift - to walk instead of running


Camera Controls
0 on the numeric keypad - look mode
Left Ctrl - puts the camera behind Rayman

Look mode is useful for looking around. Press 0 on the numeric 
keypad and hold it down, and you can then use the arrow keys 
to look around.  


Rayman has many magical powers, some of which are available in 
this demo. For example, if you press A to jump and then press 
A again, Rayman will use his hair as a helicopter. This allows 
him to fall much more slowly. Also, he can climb on a number 
of objects: rope ladders, and nets for example. When fighting 
pirates, be sure to use the strafe mode by pressing the Ctrl 
key while fighting.

============================================================
History
============================================================
Pirates have taken over Rayman's world, and they have 
imprisoned him and most of his friends. Rayman has escaped 
from the pirates, but he needs to regain his powers in order 
to free his friends from the pirates and their boss, the evil 
Razorbeard. Ly the fairy is the only one who can help him, 
but she too has been captured by the pirates. To free her, 
Rayman must battle pirates and disable the machine that 
has placed her in suspension. The pirates have broken the 
primordial energy of the world into a thousand pieces, 
called "lums". Rayman needs to recover these lums in order 
to regain his powers. Also, the red lums contain vital 
energy that can restore Rayman's health.

==========================================================
Hints
==========================================================
Many interesting things are hidden behind the bandages, 
but different techniques are needed in order to access 
the hidden passages. For example, in the beginning of the 
demo there is a bandage on the grass between Rayman and 
the pirate ship. Rayman isn't capable of breaking the 
seal by himself, but maybe he can get some help from a 
"friend". Other bandages can be broken with Rayman's fist, 
and still others need to be broken with barrels full of 
gunpowder. Rayman can pick up these barrels of gunpowder 
and throw them; this can be very useful.

Some passages are blocked and can only be opened by 
finding the right switch. To open a closed passage, Rayman 
needs to shoot the light switch with his fist.

When two walls are close enough together to form a 
crevice, Rayman can shimmy up between them by jumping 
rapidly. To jump up between two walls hit the "A" 
key rapidly.

========================================================
Known Bugs
========================================================
Please note that this is a demo and not the final version of 
the game. We are still debugging it and we know that there 
are still a number of bugs. 

Don't use the menus. If you try to change resolutions 
in the menus it will probably hang. 

Sometimes the game doesn't exit cleanly. 

There are a couple of problems with Voodoo based cards 
under different 3D APIs. We strongly recommend installing 
the Glide version if you have a Voodoo1 or Voodoo2 based card. 
If you have a Voodoo Banshee, a Voodoo Rush, or a Voodoo3 based 
graphics card, we recommend installing the Direct-X version.

A number of 3d graphics cards have problems with the drivers. 
If you suspect that you are having a problem with your drivers, 
please contact your card vendor.

We are working to correct these problems for the final version of the game. 
Thanks for your understanding.
