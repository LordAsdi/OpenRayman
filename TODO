get libepoxy, glfw in here
find suitable sound library and json library (maybe joystick, for linux??!?)
add png loading
start reverse engineering .dsb, .cnt, .apm (probably just some form of PCM, audacity), .gpt, .ptx, .sna, .snd, (gog has LEVELS0.DAT 150mb)
some files are "FIX", probably just global / fixed data?!?!?
raymanpc has some good info
